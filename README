This folder contains several files used for the communication between AtoM and CKAN tools in CENDARI project.

The main file is:

complete_atom_to_ckan.php

This file should be executed as a daily cron job. 
It checks the time of the last synchronization between two mentioned tools. Then it finds all the new/updated archival institution/description in AtoM and performs upload of a new file to CKAN, and creates new dataspace if necessary. It also stores the information of transferred files in the satellite tables of the local AtoM MySQL database, and at the end updates time of the last synchronization.

There are a few of auxiliary files:
- complete_atom_to_ckan_config.php: contains all necessary links and secret values;
- complete_atom_to_ckan_api_communication.php: implements all functions which are using API of CKAN
- complete_atom_to_ckan_database_communication.php: implements all functions that are communicating with AtoM MySQL database           
- complete_atom_to_ckan_create_eag.php: implements all functions that are used for the creation of the EAG XML files from the values stored in AtoM MySQL database

AtoM MySQL database is expanded with three satellite tables:
- harvester_ead which contains AtoM identifier of the description (atom_ead_id),  AtoM slug of the description (atom_ead_slug),  AtoM slug of the institution (atom_eag_slug), CKAN identifier of the description (repository_resource_id) and the date of the transfer from AtoM to CKAN of the description (sync_date)
- harvester_eag which contains AtoM identifier of the institution (atom_eag_id),  AtoM slug of the institution (atom_eag_slug), CKAN identifier of the institution (repository_resource_id) and the date of the transfer from AtoM to CKAN of the institutional description (sync_date)
- harvester_date which contains the date of the last synchronization

File mail_report.php should be executed as a weekly (Wednesday, 14:00) cron
job. This script sends informartion on the current number of files in AtoM and
the number of transfered files to CKAN.
